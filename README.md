## Page usage
 Search is triggered by submit button or form.
 Each item in the list has a 'fav' and 'later' button, you can interact with them form the list and shortlist
 Todo :
 * document the code 
 * user MarkButton in Shortlist component
 * re-think the data flow a bit, more elegant search on object to be done on `shortlist`, send just the id's for the `SearchForm`
 * use localStorage for cache
